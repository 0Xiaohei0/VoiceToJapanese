The Japanese voice can redirected to your in-game voice chat, discord etc. via a virtual audio cable. It uses open-ai whisper to transcribe microphone input into text. The text is then passed to DeepL Translate to convert into Japanese. Lastly Voice Vox is used to synthesize the Japanese audio output.
