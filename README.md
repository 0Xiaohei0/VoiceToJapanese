5. The program should start, from now on you can use start.bat to start the program more quickly.

Noes: I would recommend downloading the -py version because anti-virus often report false-positive for .exe files. Additionally, with the -py version you can inspect and make changes to all the python code and swap out libraries for running the AI models on GPU.

## Usage

## Additional details
- This projects uses open-ai whisper for audio transcription. A translation model is bundled for translating english to Japanese (https://huggingface.co/staka/fugumt-en-ja). The Japanese voice syntheisis is done with voicevox. All three models are ran on your local machine by default, so you can use this project without an internet connection.

- If you provide an api key from deepl translate in settings. Deepl can be used instead of the offline model, which can provide better, more natural translations.
- If you check the "Use voicevox on cloud" checkbox, Japanese audio syntheisis will happen on the cloud. If you do not provide an api key, the program will use the slow version of the API. If you provide a voicevox api key from https://voicevox.su-shiki.com/su-shikiapis/, the program will use the fast version of the API
- To have the ai speak english instead of Japanese, you can check the "use elevenlab on cloud" checkbox and provide an API key from here: https://beta.elevenlabs.io/speech-synthesis
