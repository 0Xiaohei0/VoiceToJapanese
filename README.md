Voice To Japanese is a python script that turns your microphone input into synthesized audio in Japanese. The Japanese audio output can redirected to your in-game voice chat, discord etc. via a virtual audio cable. It uses Azure tts to transcribe microphone input into text. The text is then passed to DeepL Translate to convert into Japanese. Lastly Voice Vox is used to synthesize the Japanese audio output.
